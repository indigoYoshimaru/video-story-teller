# AI-story-teller

My sister and many of her friends enjoy listening to scary or ghost stories, even though they often find them frightening. Reading these stories from other sources can be dull, and they are sometimes too lengthy. Narrating them manually requires a significant amount of effort. So, I thought, why not create a system that can read stories from text sources?

By leveraging the facebook/mms-tts models, I can develop an AI that narrates stories from text in both English and Vietnamese. This project also includes pipelines for crawling stories from Reddit, translating them to Vietnamese, and providing a user interface for editing stories and managing the Text-to-Speech (TTS) pipeline.

This repository is currently under development, so there are many updates to come, and the documentation is not yet complete. Stay tuned for more stories and updates!
